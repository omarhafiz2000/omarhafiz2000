    <section id="excerpt">
      <p>Regardless of your output goal, you cannot accurately reproduce color without a basic understanding of color
        theory. Keep in mind that we say <em>basic</em> &#8212; color theory is a complex, often confusing topic. The
        following discussion presents the issues that will help you to understand and effectively use color in design.
      </p>
      <p> In the most basic sense, color is light. Different wavelengths of light are visualized as different colors.
        The human visual system can detect light waves between 400 and 700 nanometers (nm) in length, which make up the
        <em>visible spectrum</em> or range of visible colors. Light waves below 400 nm (including ultraviolet) and above
        700 (including infrared) are not discernible by the human eye.
      </p>
      <h2> Additive Color</h2>
      <p> The additive color model is based on the idea that all colors can be reproduced by combining pure red, green,
        and blue light in varying intensities. These three colors are considered the <em>additive primaries</em>, and
        are the basis of most digital color reproduction (used by televisions, computer monitors, digital cameras, and
        scanners).</p>
      <p> Although usually considered a &#8220;color,&#8221; black is the absence of light (and, therefore, of color).
        Combining any two additive primaries at full strength produces one of the <em>additive secondaries</em> &#8212;
        red and blue light combine to produce magenta, red and green combine to produce yellow, and blue and green
        combine to produce cyan. White is the sum of all colors, produced when all three additive primaries are combined
        at full strength.</p>
      <p> Additive color theory is practically applied when a reproduction method uses light to reproduce color. A
        television screen or computer monitor is black when it is turned off. When the power is turned on, light in the
        monitor illuminates at different intensities to create the range of colors you see.</p>
      <h2> Subtractive Color</h2>
      <p> Printing pigmented inks on a substrate, of course, is a very different method of reproducing color &#8212; it
        does not begin with a black screen, and it does not involve a source of light. Reproducing color on paper
        requires <em>subtractive color theory</em>, which is essentially the inverse of additive color theory.</p>
      <p> Instead of adding red, green, and blue light to create the range of colors, subtractive color begins with a
        white surface that reflects red, green, and blue light at equal and full strength. To reflect a specific color,
        a surface must subtract or absorb only certain wavelengths from the white light. To reflect only red, for
        example, the surface must subtract (or absorb) the green and blue light.</p>
      <p> Remember that the additive primary colors (red, green, and blue) combine to create the additive secondaries
        (cyan, magenta, and yellow). Those additive secondaries are also called the &#8220;subtractive primaries,&#8221;
        because each subtracts one-third of the light spectrum, and reflects the other two thirds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Cyan absorbs red light, reflecting only blue and green light.</li>
        <li> Magenta absorbs green light, reflecting only red and blue light.</li>
        <li> Yellow absorbs blue light, reflecting only red and green light.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> A combination of two subtractive primaries, then, absorbs two-thirds of the light spectrum and reflects only
        one-third. As an example, a combination of yellow and magenta absorbs both blue and green light, reflecting only
        red.</p>
      <p> We mentioned earlier that red and green light combine to make yellow. According to additive color theory,
        yellow is the result of the absence of blue light. Using subtractive color theory, yellow reflects red and green
        light and absorbs blue; as a subtractive primary, yellow is sometimes referred to as &#8220;minus blue&#8221;
        (RGB - B = Y).</p>
      <p> To practically apply subtractive color theory (as in color printing), inks made with cyan, magenta, and yellow
        pigments are combined to absorb different wavelengths of light. To create the appearance of red, the green and
        blue light must be subtracted or absorbed, thus reflecting only red. Magenta absorbs green light, and yellow
        absorbs blue light; combining magenta and yellow inks on white paper reflects only the red light. By combining
        different amounts of the subtractive primaries, it's possible to produce a large range or <em>gamut</em> of
        colors.</p>
      <h2> Understanding Complementary Color</h2>
      <p> A basic color wheel is helpful to understand the concept of additive and subtractive color theory. As the
        colors are positioned on a color wheel, red, green, and blue (collectively called the &#8220;RGB colors&#8221;)
        are directly inverse (opposite) to cyan, magenta, and yellow (called the &#8220;CMY colors&#8221;).</p>
      <p> Referencing the color wheel allows us to understand how RGB colors relate to CMY colors. If you center an
        equilateral triangle over the color wheel, the points of the triangle touch either the RGB primaries or the CMY
        primaries. Adding together two points of the triangle results in the color between the two points. Red and blue
        combine to form magenta, yellow and cyan combine to form green, and so on. This is why the two color modes are
        said to be &#8220;directly inverse.&#8221; Each CMY color is made up of two RGB colors and vice versa.</p>
      <p> Opposite colors on the color wheel are called <em>color complements</em>. Using subtractive color theory, a
        color's complement absorbs or subtracts that color from visible white light. As an example, cyan is opposite red
        on the color wheel; cyan absorbs red light and reflects green and blue. Because you know green and blue light
        combine to create cyan, you can begin to understand how the two theories are related.</p>
      <p><em> Obviously, a red apple is not red because only red light is shining. It is red because the surface absorbs
          green and blue light and reflects red light. Cyan is red's complement - it absorbs red light. Placing a cyan
          filter over a red apple removes the red color. The same concept applies to items of different colors.</em></p>
      <h2> Human Color Perception</h2>
      <p> The most important thing to remember about color theory is that color is light, and light is color. You can
        easily prove this by walking through your house at midnight; you will notice (after your shins stop throbbing
        from bumping into the coffee table) that what little you can see appears as dark shadows.</p>
      <p> Without light, you can't see &#8212; and without light, there is no color.</p>
      <p> The biology of color vision is the heart of color perception. Because this is not a science book, we present
        here a very simplified explanation of color vision and human color perception.</p>
      <p> Light enters the eye through the lens and is focused on the retina. In the retina, a group of tiny cells
        called rods and cones (collectively referred to as &#8220;photoreceptors&#8221;) respond to the light; these
        cells stimulate special nerve cells, which pass on signals to the brain.</p>
      <p> Rods are not sensitive to color; they capture lightness information, and work best in low-light conditions.
        Rods allow you to determine how much light there is, but not the color of the light.</p>
      <p> Cones are the color receivers of the human eye. They are concentrated at the center of the retina, where the
        visual field is most focused. Cones contain a photopigment called &#8220;rhodopsin,&#8221; which stimulates an
        electrochemical response to light. There are three different types of rhodopsin; one absorbs shorter wavelengths
        of light, one absorbs medium wavelengths, and one absorbs longer wavelengths.</p>
      <p> We perceive specific colors because the pigments in an object's surface absorb different wavelengths of light
        (called &#8220;spectral absorption&#8221;), reflecting only the wavelengths that define the object's color
        (called &#8220;spectral reflectance&#8221;). As an example, a lemon's surface absorbs blue light, reflecting red
        and green wavelengths to create the visual appearance of yellow.</p>
      <p> The surface characteristics of an object absorb and reflect varying percentages of the different wavelengths.
        Because white is a combination of all colors, white paper should theoretically reflect equal percentages of all
        light wavelengths. However, different papers may absorb or reflect varying percentages of some wavelengths, thus
        defining the paper's apparent color. The paper's color will affect the appearance of ink color printed on that
        paper.</p>
      <p> A <em>spectrophotometer</em> is used to precisely measure the wavelengths that are reflected from an object's
        surface, whether that object is a natural object, a printed page, or a blank piece of paper.</p>
      <h2> How Lighting Affects Color</h2>
      <p> Additive color supposes that the three colors of light &#8212; red, green, and blue &#8212; are added to a
        black space &#8212; the lack of light &#8212; to create all the colors in the visible spectrum. According to
        subtractive color theory, cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments subtract the red, green, and blue components of
        pure white light to create the colors in the visible spectrum. The practical application of these theories,
        however, is not so simple.</p>
      <p> The light source in any particular viewing situation can (sometimes dramatically) affect the perceived color
        of an object. &#8220;White&#8221; light is rarely pure white &#8212; each of the three primaries combined at
        full strength. The color of a specific light source can add a <em>color cast</em> to a design, and can cause the
        same color to appear different under various lighting conditions (called &#8220;metamerism&#8221;).</p>
      <p> The term &#8220;color temperature&#8221; is used to define the color properties of a light source. As an
        object is heated it first glows red, then yellow, then white, then blue. Cooler color temperatures,
        correspondingly, have a yellow cast and the hottest color temperature has a blue cast. </p>
      <p> It is interesting to note that physical color temperature is contradictory to human color perception; we
        perceive yellow hues as &#8220;warm&#8221; and blues as &#8220;cool.&#8221;</p>
      <p> Fluorescent light, commonly used in office settings, ranges from 3000 to 4100K and often has a slight yellow
        or blue cast. Tungsten lights, which are commonly used in household lighting, have a color temperature around
        3000K and a pronounced yellow cast. The graphic-arts industry uses 5000K light in controlled environments
        &#8212; press rooms, proofing stations, and so on &#8212; to allow production staff to match colors created in
        the design phase. This high temperature corresponds to white light with equal amounts of red, green, and blue
        light &#8212; and no cast &#8212; for optimum color viewing conditions.</p>
      <p> As a designer, it is equally (if not more) important to consider the lighting conditions in which your final
        design will be viewed. If your product will be displayed under the fluorescent lights of a grocery store, you
        need to consider how the colors will look in those lighting conditions instead of in a controlled production
        environment.</p>
      <p> If a light source has an apparent color cast, it means red, green, and blue wavelengths of light are not
        equal. Yellow light, for example, has stronger components of red and green and a weaker blue component.</p>
      <p> Consider what would happen to a blue poster displayed under yellow lighting. The blue poster would be created
        from inks of cyan (to absorb red light) and magenta (to absorb green light), thus reflecting only blue light
        wavelengths. The yellow light source, though, would have only a weak blue component. The pigments used to create
        the blue poster would still absorb the red and green wavelengths from the light; the weaker blue wavelengths
        would be reflected, but not as brilliantly as if all three wavelengths were equally present.</p>
      <p> Such a blue sign displayed in yellow light, then, would appear more grayish&#8211;black than blue. Although
        standardized viewing conditions are essential for matching design colors on a printing press, understanding the
        practical use and display of your work is essential to creating compelling color design.</p>
      <h2> Communicating Color</h2>
      <p> The language of color can be confusing, which makes it extremely difficult to communicate specific color
        concepts. You can tell someone to use a &#8220;nice, dark red,&#8221; but what exactly is dark? And who decides
        what's &#8220;nice&#8221;?</p>
      <p> To further confuse matters, different color terms can have similar meanings or a single term can have
        different meanings. These terms might also have different meanings depending on the speaker. Your clients might
        say something vague such as, &#8220;Make that brighter&#8221; when they really want a color to be more
        saturated. Or you may hear something like, &#8220;Make that greener.&#8221; Unfortunately, we do not have a
        &#8220;Greener&#8221; button on most of our equipment, so we need to be able to translate our clients'
        statements about color into something physically meaningful.</p>
      <p> Many vague and technical-sounding terms are mentioned when discussing color. Is hue the same as color? the
        same as value? the same as tone? What is the difference between lightness and brightness? What is chroma? And
        where does saturation fit in?</p>
      <p> This problem has resulted in several attempts to normalize color communication. A number of <em>color
          systems</em> have been developed to define color according to specific criteria, including Hue, Saturation,
        and Brightness (HSB); Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (HSL); Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV); and Lightness,
        Chroma, and Hue (LCH). Each of these models or systems plots color on a three-dimensional diagram, based on the
        elements of human color perception &#8212; hue, colorfulness, and brightness.</p>
      <h3> UNDERSTANDING THE TERMS</h3>
      <p> <em> Hue</em> is what most people think of as color &#8212; red, green, purple, and so on. Hue is defined
        according to a color's position on a color wheel, beginning from red (0&deg;) and traveling counterclockwise
        around the wheel.</p>
      <p> <em> Saturation</em> (also called &#8220;intensity&#8221;) refers to the color's difference from neutral gray.
        Highly saturated colors are more vivid than those with low saturation. Saturation is plotted on a color-space
        diagram from the center of the color wheel. Color at the center of the wheel is neutral gray, and has a
        saturation value of 0; a color at the edge of the wheel has a saturation value of 100, and is the most intense
        value of the corresponding hue.</p>
      <p> If you bisect the color wheel with a straight line, the line makes up a saturation axis for two complementary
        colors. A color is dulled by the introduction of its complement. Red, for example, is neutralized by the
        addition of cyan (blue and green). As the two colors mix near the center of the wheel, the result is a neutral
        gray.</p>
      <p> <em> Chroma</em> is similar to saturation, but factors in a reference white. In any viewing situation, colors
        appear less vivid when the light source dims. The process of <em>chromatic adaptation</em>, however, allows the
        human visual system to adjust to changes in light and still differentiate colors according to the relative
        saturation. The white area of a printed page, for example, can serve as a reference point from which to adjust
        one's perception of other colors. If a particular viewing situation does not have an identifiable white point
        for reference &#8212; such as dusk in a forest &#8212; then saturation is a better measure of colorfulness than
        chroma.</p>
      <p> <em> Brightness</em> is the amount of light that is reflected. As an element of color reproduction, brightness
        is typically judged by comparing the color to the lightest nearby object (such as an unprinted area of white
        paper). It is important to note that there are many different variations of &#8220;white&#8221; paper, from the
        pristine coated paper used to print inkjet photos to the off-white newsprint used to print many books and daily
        papers; these variations affect the relative appearance of color brightness.</p>
      <p> <em> Lightness</em> is the amount of white or black added to the pure color. Lightness (also called
        &#8220;luminance&#8221; or &#8220;value&#8221;) is the relative brightness based purely on the black-white value
        of a color. In other words, lightness defines how light or dark a color is without regard to the specific color
        being described. A lightness of 0 means there is no addition of white or black. Lightness of +100 is pure white;
        lightness of -100 is pure black.</p>
      <h2> Output Color Models</h2>
      <p> Most software applications allow you to choose from built-in color libraries, or to define new colors using
        several different <em>color models</em> or <em>color spaces</em>. The color model or space defines the structure
        of the color, or how the color will be created. Two primary color spaces are used to reproduce color &#8212; RGB
        color space and CMYK color space. Other color spaces or models are used to describe and communicate color, but
        those models are not &#8220;output&#8221; models because they do not specifically create the color you see on a
        monitor or a piece of paper.</p>
      <h3> RGB Color</h3>
      <p> The RGB color space is used in any device that reproduces color with light, such as televisions and computer
        monitors. The RGB color space reproduces the range of color according to additive color theory &#8212; red,
        green, and blue light are combined in varying intensities to create any color in the visible spectrum. Each
        color or <em>channel</em> in the RGB output model has 256 possible intensities (0-255).</p>
      <p> A number of factors can affect the appearance of color on an RGB output device. The internal mechanics used to
        create the red, green, and blue channels vary from one device to another. Different types of devices use various
        technologies, such as cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The accuracy of a device's
        light source can deteriorate over time. The color of external light &#8212; such as the lamp in your office
        &#8212; can change the perceived color on the monitor. Because of these and other factors, RGB color is
        considered to be a <em>device-dependent</em> color model &#8212; the specific output device being used
        determines the final appearance of the color.</p>
      <h3> CMYK Color</h3>
      <p> The CMYK color model, also called &#8220;process color,&#8221; uses subtractive color theory to reproduce the
        range of printable colors. The process-color model recreates the range of printable colors by overlapping layers
        of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks in varying percentages from 0-100.</p>
      <p> Using theoretically pure pigments, a mixture of equal parts of cyan, magenta, and yellow would produce black.
        Real pigments, however, are not pure; the actual result of mixing these three colors usually appears as a muddy
        brown.</p>
      <p> The fourth color, black (K), is added to the three subtractive primaries to extend the range of printable
        colors, and to allow much purer blacks to be printed than is possible with only the three primaries. Black is
        abbreviated as &#8220;K&#8221; because it is the &#8220;key&#8221; color to which others are aligned on the
        printing press. This also avoids confusion with blue in the RGB color model.</p>
      <p> Like the RGB model, different factors can affect the appearance of any given CMYK build. The specific pigments
        used to make the inks, the color of paper on which a job is printed, and the color-reproduction characteristics
        of the press used can all affect the color that finally appears on the page. Because of this potential for
        difference, CMYK is also considered a device-dependent model. Color management, which we discuss in Chapter 6,
        addresses the problems associated with working in device-dependent color models.</p>
      <h4> <em> Hexachrome Color</em></h4>
      <p> Hexachrome (also called &#8220;hifi&#8221; or &#8220;high-fidelity color&#8221;) is the latest innovation in
        color printing. Standard printing presses have four printing units, one for each of the four primary CMYK inks;
        many of the new commercial printing presses, however (especially in the U.S.), have six or more printing units.
        The Hexachrome system, created by PANTONE, takes advantage of the additional printing units by adding two extra
        colors &#8212; green and orange &#8212; to the standard CMYK ink set. The green and orange units extend the
        color gamut so more shades can be reproduced on a traditional printing press.</p>
      <h4> <em> Special Color Libraries</em></h4>
      <p> Special colors, commonly called &#8220;spot colors,&#8221; are those that use a premixed ink to reproduce a
        specific color with a single ink layer &#8212; they are not built from the standard process inks used in CMYK
        printing. When you output a job with spot colors, each spot color appears on its own separation.</p>
      <p> Spot-color inks are used in two- and three-color documents, and may be added to process-color documents when a
        special color, such as a corporate color, is needed. In the United States, the most popular collections of spot
        colors are the PANTONE Matching System (PMS) libraries. TruMatch and Focoltone are also used in the U.S.; Toyo
        and DICColor (Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals) are used primarily in Japan.</p>
      <p> Special inks exist because many of the colors cannot be reproduced with process inks (in the CMYK color
        space), nor can they be accurately represented on a computer monitor (in the RGB color space). Although most
        graphics applications include on-screen simulations of the most popular special-color libraries, you should look
        at a swatch book to select a particular color instead of selecting a color directly from the electronic library.
        Furthermore, if you specify a special color in a document, but then convert it to a CMYK process color, your job
        probably won't exactly look as you expected.</p>
      <h3> CIE L*A*B* COLOR SPACE</h3>
      <p> The problems created by device-dependent color models are obvious: many devices reproduce a given color
        differently. This issue is made even worse by the fact that color is often converted from one model to another
        during the design and production processes.</p>
      <p> In 1931, the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE), an international standards-making body, developed
        the CIE XYZ color model as the first widely used <em>device-independent</em> color space. The model was modified
        and renamed <em>CIE L*a*b*</em> in 1976, and is often shortened to simply <em>L*a*b*</em>.</p>
      <p> In the L*a*b* model, color is defined numerically on three axes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> L* defines the luminance of a color, expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100.</li>
        <li> a* defines the color on the red-green axis, ranging from -128 (green) to +128 (red).</li>
        <li> b* defines the color on the yellow-blue axis, ranging from -128 (blue) to +128 (yellow).</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The L*a*b* model describes the physical characteristics of a color without considering any specific output
        device. This helps to eliminate the confusion created by different gamuts and different reproduction
        characteristics, and allows us to communicate color based solely on numbers. This color space, though not used
        for the output of color, is used as an intermediate step for converting from one color model to another.
        Spectrophotometry, defined earlier in this chapter, measures colors in the L*a*b* color space, so they can then
        be translated to either the RGB or CMY equivalent.</p>

      <h2> Understanding Gamut</h2>
      <p> Different output color models have different ranges or <em>gamuts</em> of possible colors. A normal human
        visual system is capable of distinguishing approximately 16.7 million different colors. Color reproduction
        systems, however, are far more limited.</p>
      <p> The RGB model, using light as the means to reproduce color, has the largest gamut of the output models. The
        CMYK gamut is far more limited than the RGB gamut. Many of the brightest and most saturated colors that can be
        reproduced using light cannot be reproduced using subtractive theory.</p>
      <p> The difference in gamut is one of the biggest problems graphic designers face when working with color images.
        Digital image-capture devices (including scanners and digital cameras) work in RGB space, which, with its larger
        gamut, can more closely mirror the range of colors in the original scene. Printing, however, requires such
        images to first be converted or <em>separated</em> into the CMYK color space.</p>
      <p> Depending on the images, at least some colors captured with the RGB model likely cannot be reproduced in the
        more limited gamut of the CMYK color model. These <em>out-of-gamut</em> colors pose a challenge to faithfully
        reproducing the original image. If the conversion from RGB to CMYK is not carefully controlled, <em>color
          shift</em> can result in drastic differences between the original and the printed image. Color management
        (Chapter 6) and color correction (Chapter 7) are both important tools for quality color reproduction.</p>
      <h2> Conclusion</h2>
      <p> There is, of course, far more that could be said about color theory; color science can be extremely complex
        and confusing to all but the devoted color scientist. In your role as a graphic artist, however, you need to
        understand the basics of color reproduction to address the issues that affect the colors you use. This chapter
        has examined the theories that underlie the practical application; we will refer to these concepts frequently
        throughout the rest of this book. Much time and effort is spent choosing just the right color for a job. A clear
        understanding of color-reproduction theory can help to ensure that the colors you get in the final output are
        the ones you chose in the development stage.</p>
