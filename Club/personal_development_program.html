  <p> At the Girls &amp; Boys Club, we try to offer programs to fill the gaps that are not being addressed in many inner-city public schools. We offer volunteer-led classes in a number of fields, including:</p>
  <p> <strong>Smart Girls</strong> - A health, fitness, prevention/education and self-esteem enhancement program for girls ages 8 to 17.</p>
  <p> <strong>Triple Play</strong> - Emphasizes good nutrition, regular physical activity, and improving overall well-being.</p>
  <p> <strong>Goals For Graduation</strong> - Designed to enhance Club membersâ€™ engagement with learning by providing consistent support from caring and trusted adults in developing the academic, emotional and social skills needed to achieve academic success.</p>
  <p> <strong>Money Matters</strong> - Promotes financial responsibility and independence among Club members. Participants learn how to manage a checking account, create a budget, save and invest, and pay for college.</p>
  <p> <strong>Image Makers</strong> - Encourages Club members to learn about black-and-white, color, digital and alternative process photography. The ImageMakers National Photography Program Resource Guide is full of fun, creative activity ideas</p>
  <p> <strong>Fine Arts Exhibit</strong> - Encourages artistic expression among Club members through drawing, painting, printmaking, collage, mixed media and sculpture displayed at local and regional exhibits. </p>
  <p> <strong>Drama Matters</strong> - A drama education program that encourages Club members ages 6 to 18 to engage in hands-on activities. Drama education builds self-confidence, sparks creativity and boosts academic achievement.</p>
  <p> <strong>Keystone Club</strong> - A unique teen leadership development experience provides opportunities for young people aged 14-18.</p>
  <p> <strong>Family Plus</strong> - Enables Clubs to partner with families and collaborate with other community agencies to ensure the positive development of youth through programming, resources and support.
    There is no cost to attend, and all necessary materials will be provided. </p>
